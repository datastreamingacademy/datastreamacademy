Technical Implementation Tips:

Use static site generation to minimize server costs
Leverage GitHub Pages initially if possible
Use Jupyter notebooks with Binder for interactive content
Implement serverless functions for minimal backend needs

Content Creation Strategy:

Start with written tutorials
Add screenshots and code snippets
Create simple video content using free tools
Build content library gradually while working full-time

Would you like me to dive deeper into any of these aspects or create a more detailed technical implementation plan for the initial phase? We could also:

Design a minimal first version of the site
Create a content creation schedule
Set up the basic project structure
Plan the first few tutorials
